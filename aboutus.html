          <p>Currently part of a cohort with upcoming web developers, this project was designed in alignment with my interest and my career aspirations. 
          After attempting a career in education, management, and nursing field in Illinois, I made a difficult decision to turn 180 degrees and start anew, a path I've always wanted to build into, 
          but was too intimidated to start before. 
          </p>
          <p>Growing up all the way from L.A., from Chicago, and now recently resided in New Jersey, each city I cam across was had people interested in basketball. I was not always a fan of watching 
          or playing basketball. I was put into basketball programs in my elementary/middle school years which I loathed. In the end, my interest did spark around high school. 
          Eventually, I started playing basketball a little more seriously than casually in college

          <p>I strive to continue to update this project since basketball and coding is my hobby and my future career respectively.
          </p>
          <p>Although there are already myriad of websites including ESPN and NBA that have these features already, my to-do list for this website will not end just there. There are so much room
          for creativity and details to be added. It is just a matter of time, grit, and continous increment of innovation and ideas.
