## Description

We were given the task of making a website using atleast two different web API's and a CSS framework other than bootstrap. The subject we choose to focus on was the current season stats of NBA teams.  With some searching we came across two seperate API's that would fit our needs.  The sportsdata.io API provided us with the different stat values and teams, and the ticketmaster API which would give us upcoming events for those teams.  Instead of using bootstrap for our CSS frameworks we used Bulma to help format and stylize our application.  A drop down menu was utilized to store all of the team names in it.  When a team name is selected it is stored in local storage, and a button is created below the drop down menu with the team name on the button.  The main display of the page will show tables with the stats for the team, the players for the teams and their stats, as well as the team name and abriviation.  The web pages format will change to the team colors as well as display a team logo in the main section.  On the right hand side on the page an area with the next 10 events for the selected team will show linking you to the ticketmaster website to buy tickets for those events.  Whether you select a team from the drop down menu or the previously searched buttons that populate on the page it will change to that teams information, style, events, and logo.
